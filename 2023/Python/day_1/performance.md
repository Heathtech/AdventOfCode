Some friendly and completely unfair comparison between rust and Python. If the Python solution wins, it means I somehow picked a **significantly** more efficient algorithm.

| Language | Runtime         | min ... max         | runs |   |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|------|---|
| Python   | 212.0ms Â± 9.7ms | 205.6ms ... 296.9ms | 100  |   |
|          |                 |                     |      |   |
